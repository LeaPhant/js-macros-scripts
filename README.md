## My JsMacros scripts
Here I'm sharing some scripts i use with JsMacros to make things nicer or track stats, usually in Hypixel SkyBlock.

### How to use
- Download & Install JsMacros for your version [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jsmacros/files/all). *(1.8 up to 1.18 with either Forge or Fabric supported)*
- Set the hotkey to open JsMacros GUI in Controls

- Navigate to a folder in this repo you want to use
- There will be a "Files" section which has the related files + their events listed
- Download the files and put them into `.minecraft/config/jsMacros/Macros/` (ideally into a subfolder)
- Open JsMacros GUI via the hotkey you set earlier
- Navigate to the "Events" tab at the top

- For each file you've downloaded click the "+" at the right and set click into the empty boxes to set the correct event type and file path
- Make sure you enable the events by clicking the red box saying "Disabled"
